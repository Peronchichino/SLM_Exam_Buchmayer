# Requirements
Use GitHub or Azure DevOps for the project and follow the correct DevOps procedure. Use a Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model (preferable gitflow) to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well.
